Web Scraping with HTML and CSS to extract online data

## Overview
Creating a web scraping function to accurately scrape related nasa space images and store on a pymongo database while displaying them on a bootstrap styled webapp created using Flask

## Results
We were able to use our code to scrape images and create the following table storing the image URL'S

![Hemisphere URLS](https://github.com/sbull32/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/hemisphere_urls.png)

We then used Flask to create a webapp in order to display the data we were in charge of scraping. Finally, we were able to update our webpage with bootstrap styling elements.
